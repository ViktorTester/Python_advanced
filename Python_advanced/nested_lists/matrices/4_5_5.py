# A square matrix of numbers is given. The program swaps the elements on the main
# and side diagonals, while each element must remain in the same column (that is, in each
# column, you need to swap the element on the main diagonal and on the side diagonal).

# The input to the program is a natural number n â€” the number of rows and columns in
# the matrix, then the elements of the matrix line by line, separated by a space.
