# The matrix() function creates, fills and returns a matrix of the given size.
# In this case (depending on the arguments passed), it behaves like this:

# matrix() - returns a 1x1 matrix in which the only number is zero;

# matrix(n) - returns an n Ã— n matrix filled with zeros;

# matrix(n, m) - returns a matrix of n rows and m columns filled with zeros;

# matrix(n, m, value) - returns a matrix of n rows and m columns,
# in which each element is equal to the number value.
