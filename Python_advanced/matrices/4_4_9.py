# The program receives two natural numbers n and m as input, each on a separate
# line â€” the number of rows and columns in the matrix. Next, the elements of the matrix
# themselves are introduced - words, each on a separate line; in a row there are elements
# first of the first line, then the second, and so on.

# The program reads the elements of the matrix one by one, outputs them as a matrix,
# outputs an empty row, and again the same matrix, but this time swapping rows with columns:
# the first row is output as the first column, and so on.
