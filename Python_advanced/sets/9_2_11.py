# Every student studying at school studies either mathematics or computer science,
# or both of these subjects. The head of the school has lists of students studying
# each subject. By chance, the lists of all students were mixed up.

# The program allows the supervisor to find out how many students study only one subject.

# The input to the program in the first two lines are the numbers
# m and n - the number of students studying mathematics and computer science,
# respectively. Then m + n lines follow â€” the names
# of students studying mathematics and computer science, in any order.
