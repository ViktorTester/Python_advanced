# Every student studying at school studies either mathematics or computer science,
# or both of these subjects. The head of the school has lists of students in each subject.

# The program allows the supervisor to find out how many students are studying only one subject.

# The input to the program in the first two lines are the numbers m and
# n - the number of students studying mathematics and computer science,
# respectively. Then m lines follow â€” the names of students who study
# mathematics and n lines with the names of students who study computer science.
